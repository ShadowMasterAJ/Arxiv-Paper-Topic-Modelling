                  "Exact inference of marginals in probabilistic graphical models (PGM) is known to be intractable, necessitating the use of approximate methods. Most of the existing variational techniques perform iterative message passing in loopy graphs which is slow to converge for many benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for marginal inference that is based on the incremental build-infer-approximate (IBIA) paradigm. Our algorithm converts the PGM into a sequence of linked clique tree forests (SLCTF) with bounded clique sizes, and then uses a heuristic belief update algorithm to infer the marginals. For the special case of Bayesian networks, we show that if the incremental build step in IBIA uses the topological order of variables then (a) the prior marginals are consistent in all CTFs in the SLCTF and (b) the posterior marginals are consistent once all evidence variables are added to the SLCTF. In our approach, the belief propagation step is non-iterative and the accuracy-complexity trade-off is controlled using user-defined clique size bounds. Results for several benchmark sets from recent UAI competitions show that our method gives either better or comparable accuracy than existing variational and sampling based methods, with smaller runtimes.",

                  "Large text-to-video models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity videos from arbitrary textual descriptions. However, adapting these models to tasks with limited domain-specific data, such as animation or robotics videos, poses a significant computational challenge, since finetuning a pretrained large model can be prohibitively expensive. Inspired by how a small modifiable component (e.g., prompts, prefix-tuning) can adapt a large language model to perform new tasks without requiring access to the model weights, we investigate how to adapt a large pretrained text-to-video model to a variety of downstream domains and tasks without finetuning. In answering this question, we propose Video Adapter, which leverages the score function of a large pretrained video diffusion model as a probabilistic prior to guide the generation of a task-specific small video model. Our experiments show that Video Adapter is capable of incorporating the broad knowledge and preserving the high fidelity of a large pretrained video model in a task-specific small video model that is able to generate high-quality yet specialized videos on a variety of tasks such as animation, egocentric modeling, and modeling of simulated and real-world robotics data.

It has been recognized that learning contextual knowledge from the datasets depicting user-content interaction plays a vital role in downstream tasks. Despite several studies attempting to learn contextual knowledge via pre-training methods, finding an optimal training objective and strategy for this type of task remains a challenging problem. In this work, we contend that there are two distinct aspects of contextual knowledge, namely the user-side and the content-side, for datasets where user-content interaction can be represented as a bipartite graph. To learn contextual knowledge, we propose a pre-training method that learns a bi-directional mapping between the spaces of the user-side and the content-side. We formulate the training goal as a contrastive learning task and propose a dual-Transformer architecture to encode the contextual knowledge. We evaluate the proposed method for the recommendation task. The empirical studies have demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed all the baselines with significant gains.",

GANs work by employing a generator network to create new data samples that are then assessed by a discriminator network to determine their similarity to real samples. The discriminator network is taught to differentiate between actual and synthetic samples, while the generator system is trained to generate data that closely resemble real ones. The process is repeated until the generator network can produce synthetic data that is indistinguishable from genuine data. GANs have been utilized in medical image analysis for various tasks, including data augmentation, image creation, and domain adaptation. They can generate synthetic samples that can be used to increase the available dataset, especially in cases where obtaining large amounts of genuine data is difficult or unethical. However, it is essential to note that the use of GANs in medical imaging is still an active area of research to ensure that the produced images are of high quality and suitable for use in clinical settings.",

Previous studies have endeavored to identify key aspects of customer reviews through the development of sentiment analysis models and topic models. However, extracting specific dissatisfaction factors remains a challenging task. In this study, we delineate the pain point detection problem and propose Painsight, an unsupervised framework for automatically extracting distinct dissatisfaction factors from customer reviews without relying on ground truth labels. Painsight employs pre-trained language models to construct sentiment analysis and topic models, leveraging attribution scores derived from model gradients to extract dissatisfaction factors. Upon application of the proposed methodology to customer review data spanning five product categories, we successfully identified and categorized dissatisfaction factors within each group, as well as isolated factors for each type. Notably, Painsight outperformed benchmark methods, achieving substantial performance enhancements and exceptional results in human evaluations.",

                  "Knowledge graphs have recently become the state-of-the-art tool for representing the diverse and complex knowledge of the world. Examples include the proprietary knowledge graphs of companies such as Google, Facebook, IBM, or Microsoft, but also freely available ones such as YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata. A distinguishing feature of Wikidata is that the knowledge is collaboratively edited and curated. While this greatly enhances the scope of Wikidata, it also makes it impossible for a single individual to grasp complex connections between properties or understand the global impact of edits in the graph. We apply Formal Concept Analysis to efficiently identify comprehensible implications that are implicitly present in the data. Although the complex structure of data modelling in Wikidata is not amenable to a direct approach, we overcome this limitation by extracting contextual representations of parts of Wikidata in a systematic fashion. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach through several experiments and show that the results may lead to the discovery of interesting implicational knowledge. Besides providing a method for obtaining large real-world data sets for FCA, we sketch potential applications in offering semantic assistance for editing and curating Wikidata.",

                  "Optimizing compilers, as well as other translator systems, often work by rewriting expressions according to equivalence preserving rules. Given an input expression and its optimized form, finding the sequence of rules that were applied is a non-trivial task. Most of the time, the tools provide no proof, of any kind, of the equivalence between the original expression and its optimized form. In this work, we propose to reconstruct proofs of equivalence of simple mathematical expressions, after the fact, by finding paths of equivalence preserving transformations between expressions. We propose to find those sequences of transformations using a search algorithm, guided by a neural network heuristic. Using a Tree-LSTM recursive neural network, we learn a distributed representation of expressions where the Manhattan distance between vectors approximately corresponds to the rewrite distance between expressions. We then show how the neural network can be efficiently used to search for transformation paths, leading to substantial gain in speed compared to an uninformed exhaustive search. In one of our experiments, our neural-network guided search algorithm is able to solve more instances with a 2 seconds timeout per instance than breadth-first search does with a 5 minutes timeout per instance.",

We introduce Re-determinizing IS-MCTS, a novel extension of Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (IS-MCTS) that prevents a leakage of hidden information into opponent models that can occur in IS-MCTS, and is particularly severe in Hanabi. Re-determinizing IS-MCTS scores higher in Hanabi for 2-4 players than previously published work at the time of the competition. Given the 40ms competition time limit per move we use a learned evaluation function to estimate leaf node values and avoid full simulations during MCTS. For the Mixed track competition, in which the identity of the other players is unknown, a simple Bayesian opponent model is used that is updated as each game proceeds.",

                  "Staff scheduling is a universal problem that can be encountered in many organizations, such as call centers, educational institution, industry, hospital, and any other public services. It is one of the most important aspects of workforce management strategy and the one that is most prone to errors or issues as there are many entities should be considered, such as the staff turnover, employee availability, time between rotations, unusual periods of activity, and even the last-minute shift changes. The nurse scheduling problem is a variant of staff scheduling problems which appoints nurses to shifts as well as rooms per day taking both hard constraints, i.e., hospital requirements, and soft constraints, i.e., nurse preferences, into account. Most algorithms used for scheduling problems fall short when it comes to the number of inputs they can handle. In this paper, constraint programming was developed to solve the nurse scheduling problem. The developed constraint programming model was then implemented using python programming language.",

                  "World-class human players have been outperformed in a number of complex two person games (Go, Chess, Checkers) by Deep Reinforcement Learning systems. However, owing to tractability considerations minimax regret of a learning system cannot be evaluated in such games. In this paper we consider simple games (Noughts-and-Crosses and Hexapawn) in which minimax regret can be efficiently evaluated. We use these games to compare Cumulative Minimax Regret for variants of both standard and deep reinforcement learning against two variants of a new Meta-Interpretive Learning system called MIGO. In our experiments all tested variants of both normal and deep reinforcement learning have worse performance (higher cumulative minimax regret) than both variants of MIGO on Noughts-and-Crosses and Hexapawn. Additionally, MIGO's learned rules are relatively easy to comprehend, and are demonstrated to achieve significant transfer learning in both directions between Noughts-and-Crosses and Hexapawn.",

                  "Exact inference of marginals in probabilistic graphical models (PGM) is known to be intractable, necessitating the use of approximate methods. Most of the existing variational techniques perform iterative message passing in loopy graphs which is slow to converge for many benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for marginal inference that is based on the incremental build-infer-approximate (IBIA) paradigm. Our algorithm converts the PGM into a sequence of linked clique tree forests (SLCTF) with bounded clique sizes, and then uses a heuristic belief update algorithm to infer the marginals. For the special case of Bayesian networks, we show that if the incremental build step in IBIA uses the topological order of variables then (a) the prior marginals are consistent in all CTFs in the SLCTF and (b) the posterior marginals are consistent once all evidence variables are added to the SLCTF. In our approach, the belief propagation step is non-iterative and the accuracy-complexity trade-off is controlled using user-defined clique size bounds. Results for several benchmark sets from recent UAI competitions show that our method gives either better or comparable accuracy than existing variational and sampling based methods, with smaller runtimes.",

                  "Knowledge graphs have recently become the state-of-the-art tool for representing the diverse and complex knowledge of the world. Examples include the proprietary knowledge graphs of companies such as Google, Facebook, IBM, or Microsoft, but also freely available ones such as YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata. A distinguishing feature of Wikidata is that the knowledge is collaboratively edited and curated. While this greatly enhances the scope of Wikidata, it also makes it impossible for a single individual to grasp complex connections between properties or understand the global impact of edits in the graph. We apply Formal Concept Analysis to efficiently identify comprehensible implications that are implicitly present in the data. Although the complex structure of data modelling in Wikidata is not amenable to a direct approach, we overcome this limitation by extracting contextual representations of parts of Wikidata in a systematic fashion. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach through several experiments and show that the results may lead to the discovery of interesting implicational knowledge. Besides providing a method for obtaining large real-world data sets for FCA, we sketch potential applications in offering semantic assistance for editing and curating Wikidata.",

        "\n",
        "The text processing pipeline involves several steps to clean, normalize, and prepare the text data for further analysis. Each step is crucial for improving the quality and relevance of the text data, which ultimately enhances the performance of downstream tasks such as clustering and topic modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. Stop Words Removal**\n",
        "Stop words are common words (such as \"the\", \"is\", \"in\") that occur frequently in the text but do not carry significant meaning. Removing these words helps in reducing the dimensionality of the text data and improving the performance of text analysis algorithms. Custom stop words specific to the domain (e.g., \"method\", \"result\") are also added to the list to further reduce noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Phrase Extraction**\n",
        "Phrase extraction involves identifying common phrases (bigrams and trigrams) in the text data using techniques like the Gensim Phrases model. This step helps in capturing multi-word expressions (e.g., \"machine learning\", \"neural network\", \"deep learning model\") that carry significant meaning and are treated as single tokens in subsequent analysis. The double bigram model is used to form better trigrams, ensuring that important multi-word expressions are accurately captured.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. TF-IDF Vectorization**\n",
        "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization converts the text data into numerical features by calculating the importance of words in the corpus. The term frequency (TF) measures how frequently a word appears in a document, while the inverse document frequency (IDF) measures how important a word is by considering its occurrence across all documents. This step helps in identifying the most relevant terms in the text data. Additionally, low TF-IDF terms are identified and added to the stop words list to further reduce noise in the text data.\n",

        "> **Phrase Extraction vs. N-gram Range in Vectorizer**\n",
        "When deciding between phrase extraction and using an n-gram range in the vectorizer, I opted for phrase extraction for several reasons:\n",
        "> - **Phrase Extraction**: By using models like Gensim's Phrases, I can identify and extract common phrases (bigrams and trigrams) from the text data. This method helps in capturing meaningful multi-word expressions that frequently occur together, such as \"machine learning\" or \"neural network\". These phrases are then treated as single tokens in subsequent analysis, which significantly improves the quality of the text data.\n",
        "> - **N-gram Range in Vectorizer**: While setting the n-gram range in the vectorizer (e.g., `ngram_range=(1, 3)`) allows the vectorizer to consider unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams during the text vectorization process, it may also include less meaningful combinations of words that do not occur frequently together. This can lead to increased dimensionality and noise in the text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "> __By choosing phrase extraction, I ensure that only meaningful and frequent multi-word expressions are captured, reducing noise and improving the relevance of the text data for analysis. This approach aligns better with my goal of enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as clustering and topic modeling.__\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. Final Text Cleaning**\n",
        "After updating the stop words list with low TF-IDF terms, the text data is cleaned again to remove these terms. This step ensures that only the most relevant words are retained in the text data, further reducing noise and improving the quality of the text data for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Justification of Steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminates common words that do not add significant meaning, reducing noise in the text data.\n",
        "2. **Phrase Extraction**: Captures multi-word expressions that carry significant meaning, improving the quality of the text data.\n",
        "3. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Identifies the most relevant terms in the text data, enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.\n",
        "4. **Final Text Cleaning**: Ensures that only the most relevant words are retained, improving the quality and relevance of the text data for analysis.\n"

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aimed to analyze and compare research papers from the ArXiv repository for the periods 2019-2020 and 2023-2024. The workflow involved several key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Collection**: Research papers were fetched from ArXiv based on specified categories and time periods, resulting in two datasets.\n",
        "2. **Data Visualization**: The distribution of categories and the number of papers published over time were visualized, showing trends and shifts in research focus.\n",
        "3. **Text Processing**: Techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, and phrase extraction were applied to clean the abstracts, reducing noise and improving data quality.\n",
        "4. **Clustering**: KMeans clustering was used to group similar papers, and the optimal number of clusters was determined using **distortion** and **silhouette scores**.\n",
        "    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: t-SNE was employed to visualize the clusters in a two-dimensional space, revealing the relationships between different research topics.\n",
        "5. **Topic Modeling**: LDA topic modeling identified key topics in the research papers, with **coherence** and **perplexity** metrics guiding the selection of the optimal number of topics.\n",
        "6. **Comparison**: The topics between the two time periods were compared, highlighting shifts in research focus and emerging trends.\n",
        "7. **Advanced Topic Modeling**: BERTopic was employed to further refine the topic modeling process, leveraging BERT embeddings and clustering algorithms to generate more coherent topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results\n",
        "From K-means clustering, meaningful clusters were challenging to create due to the dataset's diverse vocabulary and jargon. However, t-SNE visualization clarified relationships between research topics. Topic modeling identified key topics in both periods, with some remaining consistent and others evolving.
